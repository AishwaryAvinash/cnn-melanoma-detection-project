# cnn-melanoma-detection-project
This project aims to build a CNN-based model to accurately detect melanoma, a dangerous type of skin cancer. With 75% of skin cancer deaths caused by melanoma, the model will evaluate images and assist dermatologists in diagnosing the disease, reducing manual effort and improving early detection.
